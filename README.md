Welcome to Digital Week 2024!
This project is meant to be a cool looking presentation for the interactive quiz questions in the school-wide Scavenger Hunt Event.

## ‚ùî About

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a terminal-like UI. It's basicly made to look like a stereotypical vintage "hacker" terminal. It was inspired by Blooket's Cryptohack interface, using the same method to achieve that look. I won't call it stealing because they stole it from a random codepen first.

This (will) also incorporate custom composed sound design to enhance the user experience and make it more immersive. This will have an ambient background track that plays at the title screen, then techie sounds will play during the main question unveiling and instruction process. (I'm planning to do a "Your next mission, should you choose to accept it, is to blah blah" thing for instructions bit.)

When the page loads, users see the title screen. All dynamic elements in this page will loop seamlessly as to be shown on the screen for a while as we wait for players to arrive at our location.

When pressing enter, the text fade out, and a console animation is shown. This output mimics a random command prompt session, simulating the installation of a package. For the output, I yoinked some random package installation output and changed the name of the base deb file (in Kali Linux, to rub in the "this is peak nerd week"). Then, the question is animated in, and there is a kahoot/blooket like interface to choose your answer. It either displays it as correct or incorrect, then moves on.

## üìÉ TODO

- **Sound Design**: Ambient Sound Design and BGM for the website.

- **Hint to the Next Stall**: After the user answers the question, the question disappears, then a new (unplanned) animation reveals the hint to find the next question of the scavenger hunt somewhere else in the school.
