# Digital Week 2024 Scavenger Hunt

Welcome to Digital Week 2024!
This project is meant to be a cool looking presentation for the interactive quiz questions in the school-wide Scavenger Hunt Event.

## Features

NOTE: This section is basically a TODO for now.

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a terminal-like interface. This interface is designed to mimic a stereotypical vintage terminal. It was inspired by Blooket's Cryptohack interface, using the same way to achieve that look. I won't call it stealing because they stole it from a random codepen first.

This (will) also incorporate custom composed sound design to enhance the user experience and make it more immersive. This will have an ambient background track that plays at the title screen, then techie sounds will play during the main question unveiling and instruction process. (I'm planning to do a "Your next mission, should you choose to accept it, is to blah blah" thing for instructions bit.)

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**: When the page loads, users see the title screen. All dynamic elements in this page will loop seamlessly as to be shown on the screen for a while as we wait for players to arrive at our location. The interface has an ambient BGM track with a blinking prompt to press enter to begin the quiz.

2. **Starting the Quiz**: When pressing enter, the title, subtitle, and prompt fade out, and the console output is displayed. This output mimics a terminal session, with each line of text appearing one after the other to simulate the installation of a package. For the output, I yoinked some random package installation output and changed the name of the base deb file (in Kali Linux, to rub in the "this is peak nerd week").

3. **Sound Design**: Ambient Sound Design and BGM for the website. 

4. **Hint to the Next Stall**: After the user answers the question, the question disappears, then a new (unplanned) animation reveals the hint to find the next question of the scavenger hunt somewhere else in the school.

## Getting Started

Coming soon :/
